# Architecture

This repo holds two apps that share one Express server and one Vite frontend:

- the earlier **usage dashboard** (`server/src/*.ts`, `frontend/src/App.tsx`), reachable at `#/usage`;
- **Podium**, a live fleet console for Claude Code sessions (`mod/podium-reporter/`, `server/src/fleet/`,
  `frontend/src/fleet/`), the default view at `#/`.

`docs/SPEC.md` is the build spec for Podium. This file records how it was actually built, where it differs
from the spec and why, what was verified, and what is still open.

## Spec questions

Places where the spec was silent, ambiguous or wrong, the reading chosen, and why.

1. **"Identical type declarations" in both `protocol.ts` files (T0.1).** The mod has no use for the view
   types (`SessionView`, `Kpis`, ...). Reading chosen: the Report family (`Report`, `SessionReport`, `Plan`,
   `AgentReport`, `Failure`, `ActivityEvent` and their small helper types) lives between
   `// <protocol:begin>` and `// <protocol:end>` markers in both files, and the comparison covers that block.
   The view types live only in the server's file.
2. **Where the "sibling file" comparison runs (T0.1).** `claude plugin test` runs the mod's tests in the
   hooks sandbox, which has no file system, so a mod test cannot read the server's file. Reading chosen: the
   comparison lives in `server/src/fleet/protocol.test.ts` and reads both files. The comparison is
   symmetric, so one test covers both directions.
3. **Named sub-types.** Sections 6.2 and 7.4 write some shapes inline (`tokens`, `context`, `git`). The code
   names them (`TokenCounts`, `ContextFill`, `GitInfo`, `RateLimit`, `PlanStep`, `SessionReport`) so the
   validator, the server and the UI share them. The structure is unchanged.
4. **Omitted optional fields.** 6.2 says missing optional fields are `null`, never omitted. The validator
   accepts an omitted nullable field as `null` rather than rejecting the report (7.7: "reject, never crash,
   on junk" is about junk; a missing nullable is not junk). Required fields must be present.
5. **Over-long line lists.** `outputTail` keeps the **last** 12 lines and `evidence` the **first** 5;
   each line is clamped to 240 characters. These are clamped, not rejected, like other strings.
6. **Control characters.** Every reported string has C0 control characters (except tab) and DEL replaced
   by a space before it is stored. Newlines in single-line fields would break the UI's one-line layouts.

## Dependencies added

None at run time. `@types/node` in `server/` went from 20 to 24 so `node:sqlite` is declared.

## Phase log

### Phase 0: contract and scaffolding

Built: `server/src/fleet/protocol.ts` (types and `validateReport`), the mod's copy of the Report types,
`docs/fixtures/report.sample.json`, `.gitignore` entries for `data/` and `*.sqlite*`, the Vite proxy to
`127.0.0.1:$PORT`, and the `podium:sim` and `podium:smoke` root scripts.

Verified: `npm test` (server 26, frontend 15 tests) and `npm run build` pass. The fixture validates. The two
Report blocks match.

Found: `import { DatabaseSync } from 'node:sqlite'` fails under vitest 2 (Vite strips the `node:` prefix
and then cannot resolve `sqlite`). `process.getBuiltinModule('node:sqlite')` works under vitest, `tsx` and
plain `node`, and is typed by `@types/node` 24, so `db.ts` uses it. No fallback to `better-sqlite3` was
needed.

Not verified yet: the SSE proxy through Vite (T4.1 checks it).
